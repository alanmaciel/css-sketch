    Why spend $1000s hiring a designer?

    -- Testimonials
    I highly recommend it for developers and product builders...I created a
    good enough design myself, without much time or money, and was
    able to launch my product. —Eric Davis, @edavis10

    Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be 
    accomplished by the talented few. That's bullshit. Design is a skill that
     can be learned. It's also a process that can be reverse-engineered, to a
      degree. Jarrod's book will give you a huge head-start in both. 
      —Jarkko Laine, @jarkko

      -- FAQ section
      Why should you become the designer?
      Because designers are expensive and templates are created without 
      any understanding of the problem they propose to solve. With basic
       knowledge, you can create a design that is more than good enough
        to launch a new business.

        Who is this book for?
        The book is written primarily for programmers, but founders of all 
        backgrounds and skill sets will learn just as well. Those not familiar
         with coding might not recognize a couple of terms, but the core”

         “Does the book cover this or that specific design topic?
         This book contains the minimum design fundamentals that 
         bootstrappers must understand in order to launch a business. 
         My intent is to emphasize design basics. You’ll notice some topics, 
         even popular ones, are absent. This is not because such topics 
         are unimportant but because they are neither suitable for beginners
          nor relevant to their bottom line.

          Note about .ePub &amp; .Mobi formats:
          For better viewing of the graphics and illustrations, consider using
           the PDF version of this eBook. The .ePub and .Mobi formats provide
            limited control over graphics and typography, and thus are less ideal
             for a design book. I've made every effort to ensure they are readable 
             and useful for quick reference.

             I’m a web designer and bootstrapper. I believe in bootstrappers and
              the businesses they are building, and I know design can help them
               succeed. I’ve completed work for such diverse clients as funded tech
                startups, financial companies, movie studios, and consumer brands
                 working at agencies and as a freelancer. I write code. I prefer getting
                  things done to just talking about it. I want to help your startup succeed
                   with practical but effective design.
