      <h2>Why spend $1000s hiring a designer?</h2>

      <div class="testimonials">
        <p>"I highly recommend it for developers and product builders...I created a
          good enough design myself, without much time or money, and was
          able to launch my product." —Eric Davis, @edavis10</p>
        <p>"Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be 
          accomplished by the talented few. That's bullshit. Design is a skill that
          can be learned. It's also a process that can be reverse-engineered, to a
          degree. Jarrod's book will give you a huge head-start in both."
